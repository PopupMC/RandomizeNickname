## Randomize nickname

Allows nickname randomization for anonymity. Either lightly with /rnick
or full obfuscation with /anick.

Probably one of the most intensive plugin I made as I had to hand-craft
a list of thousands of words that were all family friendly safe and there
wasnt much help on this online.

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
